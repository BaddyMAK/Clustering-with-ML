# Clustering-with-ML 
## objectives: 
This script is composed by two parts: 
-The first part consists on performing the agglomerative clustering on the data of chronic kidney disease and comment the results. 
-The second part aims to help medical doctors in moles analysis by analyzing the border of each mole presented in a given image using the K-means clustering algorithm of Scikit learn. 

Knowing that, doctors to diagnose melanoma moles consider not only borders but also four other features: asymmetry, color, diameter and evolution. 

After performing the K-means algorithm on each of the given image and extracting the mole area, it is required to find the corresponding contour. Also, evaluate the perimeter of a circle that has an area equal to the mole area then evaluate the ratio between the perimeter of the mole and the perimeter of the circle.
